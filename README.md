## This is a very bare bone version of an 
## MSU Loader for Debian distros of Linux
It is super simple to setup and does the following:

1 - Changes any file you download to your MSU file name

2 - Moves the file into your MSU folder

3 - Loads the Emulator, Tracker and Timer

### Dependancies
Python

### Setup
Download the py file and save it anywhere

Edit the file using vim /target/snes.py or any other Python editor

Change all the file paths to reflect your directories.

### Run the script
in any terminal go to the path your your snes.py and run it using:

python3 snes.py

### Pyinstaller:
If you like to make it an executable instead you can use pyinstaller with the script

### WIP:
Make it run on GUI
